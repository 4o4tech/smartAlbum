###Intruduction

This project is my senior project, 
Many resource come from internet, most of knowledge I learning by myself.
Thanks open source, github, Interent; And enjoy build great and wounderful things for this world.

###Abstract

The aim of “smartAlbum” application will automatically classify videos and images into different collection, 
rely on machine learning train model to understand video content. This mobile application will give user more convenience and efficient method to manage their videos and images in mobile devices.
With the emergence of larger databases and more complex challenges, video understanding including the detection, tracking and pose estimation, from short video or long time security monitoring video analysis. The purpose of this project makes machine substitute manual work when people need to analyze huge quantities of data. Base on frontier research results to build a new application in daily life.

###About project

This project use machine learning trainning data and build pre-trained model base on 
 [Moments in Time](http://moments.csail.mit.edu/).
User uplaod their video (short video only) and server will base on pre-trained model to predict content(human's behavior) in the video.
